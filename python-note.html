      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-1">What computer could do?</h1>
      <p>Playing audio and video? Writing article? Surfing internet?</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that modern computer can perfectly do a lot more but not limited to above list. Although the computing ability has been improved tremendously 18 months by 18 months, the thing that a computer can do is always the same: </p>
      <p>The thing that can be computed and solved in limited specific steps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-2">Programming script</h1>
      <p>The programming script is a combination of bunch of instructions which could be understand and executed by computer step by step. These instructions are what we people want the computer to do.</p>
      <p>A script is always a plain text file stored in our computer's hard drive. When people run the script, an software called interpreter is called to read and execute the instructions in this script.</p>
      <p>In python language, python is the interpreter, and the *.py files are the executed scripts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-3">About functions</h1>
      <p>In the world of developers, nobody like repetition. To avoid this, smart developers like to put some instructions for a particular function into a capsuled text block. Then give a specific name to this block. When such function are needed, developers don't have to rewrite the whole thing again, but only call the name of the text block and all lines in this block would be executed.</p>
      <p>That saves time and life.</p>
      <p>This text block is called a function, or a procedure. Developer could refer to this function by the given name when it was defined.</p>
      <p>Usually, a typical function or procedure might take <span class="em-in-article">INPUT</span> date from outside the function. Then the function could manipulate its input as the commands or instructions it has, and return a <span class="em-in-article">OUTPUT</span> to the outside world. Such as print some information on the screen, give a calculation result to other functions, etc.</p>

      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-4">How to solve problems</h1>
      <p><cite>While there is problem, there is programming.</cite> </p>
      <p>Computer is born to solve problem. But it is as stupid as they always be. Computer only can do what we people tell it to do. Actually, people have to know how to solve the problem by ourselves.</p>
      <p>Some tasks are easy to put, like print "Hello World" or calculate sum of 13 and 7. These probably are not a problem. When it is coming to the real problems which are not so easy to figure out, these rules could be applied:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="strong">Don't panic</li>
        <li class="strong">What are the inputs?</li>
        <li class="strong">What are the outputs?</li>
        <li class="strong">Work through some examples by hand.</li>
        <li class="strong">Simple mechanical solution.</li>
        <li class="strong">Develop incrementally and test as we go.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="article">
      <h1 class="article-title" id="item-5">Frequently found coding errors</h1>
      <p>Here are some errors always found in a python script:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt class="definition-title">missing colon</dt>
        <dd>In such cases the colon might be missing:
          <ul>
            <li>def functionName():</li>
            <li>if/else statement</li>
            <li>for/while loops</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt class="definition-title">equal sign</dt>
        <dd>When compare two values, mostly in if statement, the equal sign <span class="em-in-article">==</span> is often misused as assignment <span class="em-in-article">= .</span></dd> 
        <dt class="definition-title">return statement</dt>
        <dd>Although not all functions need return something, it is important to remember the <span class="em-in-article">return</span> statement where the output date need to be given out to other functions.</dd>
        <dt class="definition-title">variable called before value assignment</dt>
        <dd>In python, a variable must be assigned to a value before it would be called or used. Otherwise python interpreter would stop the program and cast an error as: <cite>name *** is not defined.</cite> Here *** stands for the variable name you'd like to refer to.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h1 id="item-6" class="article-title">Understand Object Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p><span class="em-in-article">Object Oriented Programming</span>, OOP for short, is programming organized by objects, other than actions. OOP is mainly about how to create object from a type of instance, and manipulate the object's data or use its methods.</p>
      <p>The great thing about OOP is that you can make many objects based on different classes, but you don't really have to explicitly define them. Such objects are also called the instance of the object, or of the class.</p>
      <p><span class="em-in-article">In large programs</span>, such as a movie database site, or an e-commerce site, there always be a lot of objects share the same properties, or are controlled by the same method. OOP provides the simple and efficient way to create and use such objects.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the current type of objects are not meet the requirements. Thus new type of objects could be defined, either completely new or inherited from a existing object. By inheritance, all the class variables and methods are acquired automatically by child object, or you can override the data acquired from parent class, or writhe completely new method in the child class.</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h1 id="item-7" class="article-title">Python programming practice</h1>
      <p>In python standard library, there're lots of powerful modules, like <span class="em-in-article">os</span>, <span class="em-in-article">urllib</span>, <span class="em-in-article">webbrowser</span>, etc. When we need manipulate files or folder, we could import os to do these tasks. If we want to create a object of an website, we might use urllib. The standard library is so powerful and it's easy to find.</p>
      <p>Besides that, there're also many 3rd party libraries we could find. These libraries or modules are not included in python directly, means that you have to download and installed it before importing.</p>

      <h1 id="item-8" class="article-title">Abstract Thinking</h1>
      <p><cite>In real world, Abstract Thinking is generally compared to Concrete Thinking. A concrete thinker can see that this ball is big; a more abstract thinker can think about size in general.</cite></p>
      <p>To control the styles or behavior of bunch of elements in HTML, class property is alway used. This class name could be used as CSS selector to control the style of these elements all together. The benefits of this is that we don't have to define CSS rules for each of these elements, but one rule for all. </p>
      <p>In python programming, we define a class to represent an object. As soon as the class is defined, an instance of this class can be made and used without thinking about the details behind the scene. </p>

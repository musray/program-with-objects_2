      <h1 id="item-1" class="article-title">Introduce CSS</h1>
      <p>CSS is <span class="em-in-article">Cascading Style Sheet</span> for short. Browser knows how to render text content or media content base on the rules defined in CSS.CSS can define rules for background color of an web page, font face and size and color of text, the absolute or relative position of elements inside an web page, and more and more.</p>
      <h1 id="item-2" class="article-title">How CSS works with HTML</h1>
      <p>Browser use <span class="em-in-article">selector</span> to connect CSS rules and HTML elements.</p>
      <p>An selector usually could be the <span class="em-in-article">tag</span>, <span class="em-in-article">class name</span> or <span class="em-in-article">id</span> of an element. The CSS rules definition code for each HTML element is leading by that kind of selector. When a browser render the web page, it could find HTML elements associated with the particular CSS selectors and use the rule defined under that selector.</p>
      <h1 id="item-3" class="article-title">The great thing about CSS</h1>
      <p>Tags, class are always repeatedly in an web page.There might be 3 h2 level headlines or 5 divisions classified to a particular class name. With CSS and selector, the great thing is that you don't have to define the style rule to the 3 h2 heading, or 5 divisions repeatedly. Just defined the rule with a appropriate selector one time, all the elements related to this selector could be styled.</p>
      <p>This could avoid repetition, which is truly loved by developers.</p>
